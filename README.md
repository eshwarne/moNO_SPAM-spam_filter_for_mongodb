# moNO_SPAM-spam_filter_for_mongodb
Using the techniques of NLP and machine learning we classify the messages in a chat as spam or not spam
# Abstract
With much spam and forward messages in the flow, though it cannot be eradicated, it is important to reduce it as much as possible. Also, we have to make sure that no redundant messages are sent often
We use python's TextBlob NLP to achieve spam filtering in the mongodb nosql database
